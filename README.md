# CNL
A library of tools for use with complex numbers & other math utilities I need

## Why
I made this library to help me learn about Complex Numbers and design a library to aid in the more tedious tasks

## Usage
To install this libaray locally, clone this repo, then run the following
```sh
# Windows
py3 setup.py develop

# Linux
sudo python3 setup.py develop
```

Using the `develop` mode instead of `install` will allow you to make edits to the code in this repo, and have the library automatically update. 

This library can now be used via a normal import statement:
```python
import cnl
```

## TODO
I would like to add the ability to tell if a number is prime and reduce radicals
